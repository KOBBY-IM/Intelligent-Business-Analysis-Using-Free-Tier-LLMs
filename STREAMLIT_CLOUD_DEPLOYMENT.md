# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Complete Deployment Instructions

Your LLM evaluation system is now ready for Streamlit Cloud deployment! This guide walks you through the complete process.

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Fixed Blind Responses ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Generated `data/fixed_blind_responses.json` (116KB, 60 responses)
- [x] Contains responses from all 3 providers (Groq, Gemini, OpenRouter)
- [x] Covers 20 questions (10 retail + 10 finance)

### 2. Required Files Status
- [x] `streamlit_app.py` - Cloud entry point
- [x] `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- [x] `.streamlit/config.toml` - Production config
- [x] Core data files ready

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit and Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add the fixed responses file to git
git add data/fixed_blind_responses.json

# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add fixed blind responses for Streamlit Cloud deployment

- Generated 60 fixed LLM responses (20 questions × 3 providers)
- Includes comprehensive RAG context for each question
- Ensures consistent blind evaluation across all users
- Ready for production Streamlit Cloud deployment"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin master
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. **Go to Streamlit Cloud**: https://share.streamlit.io/
2. **Sign in** with your GitHub account
3. **Click "New app"**
4. **Configure your app**:
   - Repository: `KOBBY-IM/Intelligent-Business-Analysis-Using-Free-Tier-LLMs`
   - Branch: `master`
   - Main file path: `streamlit_app.py`
   - App URL: Choose your preferred subdomain

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In Streamlit Cloud, add these environment variables in the app settings:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
STREAMLIT_ENV=production
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

Once deployed, test these features:
- [ ] Main page loads correctly
- [ ] Fixed blind responses are displayed
- [ ] User can select preferences
- [ ] Feedback is recorded
- [ ] Metrics dashboard works
- [ ] Export functionality works

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Missing Fixed Responses Error
If you see "❌ Fixed blind responses not found!", it means the file wasn't uploaded properly:

1. **Verify file is in repository**:
   ```bash
   ls -la data/fixed_blind_responses.json
   ```

2. **Check git status**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git ls-files data/
   ```

3. **If file is missing from git**:
   ```bash
   git add data/fixed_blind_responses.json
   git commit -m "Add fixed blind responses for cloud deployment"
   git push origin master
   ```

### Memory or Performance Issues
If the app runs slowly:
- Fixed responses (116KB) are pre-loaded for fast access
- No real-time LLM calls during blind evaluation
- RAG pipeline only loads when needed

### API Rate Limits
For production use:
- Monitor API usage in provider dashboards
- Rate limiting is built-in
- Consider upgrading API tiers if needed

## 📊 Production Features

### What Works in Cloud Deployment:
- ✅ **Blind Evaluation**: Fixed responses ensure consistency
- ✅ **User Feedback**: Logs preferences securely
- ✅ **Metrics Dashboard**: Performance analytics
- ✅ **Export Results**: Download evaluation data
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: API protection built-in
- ✅ **Security**: Input validation and sanitization

### Data Flow:
1. User sees randomized, fixed LLM responses
2. User selects preferred response
3. Preference logged with metadata
4. Results exported for analysis

## 🎯 Research Benefits

### Consistent Evaluation:
- All users see identical responses
- No variation due to API calls
- Fair comparison across providers
- Reproducible research results

### Statistical Validity:
- Large sample size capability
- Structured data collection
- Exportable for statistical analysis
- Professional academic presentation

## 📈 Post-Deployment

### Monitor Usage:
- Check Streamlit Cloud analytics
- Monitor API key usage
- Review user feedback logs
- Export results periodically

### Academic Use:
- Share app URL with study participants
- Collect responses over study period
- Export CSV for statistical analysis
- Include in thesis/publication

## 🚀 Live App URL

After deployment, your app will be available at:
`https://your-chosen-subdomain.streamlit.app`

Share this URL with study participants for data collection.
